What is cohort analysis?
A cohort is simply a group of people with shared characteristics.

Cohort analysis is a type of behavioral analytics in which you group your users based on their shared traits to better
track and understand their actions. Cohort analysis allows you to ask more specific, targeted questions and make informed
product decisions that will reduce churn and drastically increase revenue. You could also call it customer churn analysis.
